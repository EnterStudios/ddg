==============================
Sun Grid Engine job submission
==============================

The execution/run script generated by alanine_scanning functions as both a submission script for a workstation and for an SGE cluster
engine.

In the documentation below, we only describe the changes needed to run the script on the default dataset on an
SGE cluster; the user is referred to the documentation in protocols/alanine-scanning/README.rst for a more detailed
explanation of what the script does and how to change the input parameters.

In particular, the *Configuration* section of protocols/alanine-scanning/README.rst should be followed for the commands below
to work.

----------------------------
Paths and extensions
----------------------------

The command lines below use placeholders for paths and extensons. Please change these appropriately *e.g.*:

::

  WORKING_DIRECTORY=.
  BENCHMARK_PATH=<path/to/alanine-scanning>
  OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=<directory created by the setup_alanine_scanning.py script>

The output directory will be named according the the current date and username *e.g.* *15-02-02-12-00_username_alanine_scanning*.

-----------------------------
How to run the full benchmark
-----------------------------

These commands run the full benchmark for the Kortemme & Baker dataset.

::

  cd ${BENCHMARK_PATH}/protocols/alanine-scanning
  python setup_alanine_scanning.py
  cd ${BENCHMARK_PATH}/protocols/alanine-scanning/job_output/${OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}/
  qsub alascan_run.py

  # if execution is successful
  cd ${BENCHMARK_PATH}/protocols/alanine_scanning
  python analyze.py ${BENCHMARK_PATH}/protocols/alanine-scanning/job_output/${OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}
